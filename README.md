# Floppy
This is a reimplementation of my domino AI made in Prolog. This time is gonne be made in C++ to improve performance and practice the language. It is intended to make it interactable through a front-end app and an API. You can use the API as an interface to play with your own AI and do whatever you want.

I want you to know that I'm very thankful for the support~
Even if you can't do it monetarily I will be glad if you can point out bugs/improvements in this project since I'm relatively new to the language. I will do my best, but is also good to have a little help sometimes ðŸ™‚

Also I would love to shout out the supporters from Buy Me a Coffee down below:
